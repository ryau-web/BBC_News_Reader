The user can download the latest news headlines from:

This application shows the titles in a listview. When the user selects an item, it shows the details about the news article. It shows the title, description, and date of the article, as well as a link to the website for the article. Clicking on the link should load the Android web browser to that page.
The user can save articles to a favourites list for later viewing. The user can also delete articles from the favourites list.
